root structure:
- drivers: physical, individual device drivers (NICs, serial cards, etc) and general drivers (keyboard, mouse, io, networking)
- hw: core hardware (cpu, interrupts, ports, timer, memory)
- lib: useful functions used multiple places elsewhere. no individual functionality
- user: all userspace items (shell, scheduler, status bar, gui)
- kernel.c: main kernel file, initializes all hardware and starts scheduler loop
- multiboot.h: allows parsing of a multiboot header
